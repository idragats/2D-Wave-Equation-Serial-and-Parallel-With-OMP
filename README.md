# 2D Wave Equation

In this C code we calculate the wave displacement for 2D wave equation using Ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
We compute node values at the next time step knowing nodes values for the previous time step and node values before previous time step.
We get a snapshots for every different time: t=0, t=5, t=10 and t=20.
Finally we convert the code as parallel with OMP format
